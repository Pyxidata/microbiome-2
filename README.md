<h1>
  Description
</h1>

<p>
  Microbiome is an ever-evolving ecosystem simulation where, unlike many other such simulators, each organism is not limited to its predefined species.
  A single organism is comparable to a fictional protein, essentially a chain of amino acids which are defined by its genetic information. 
  A set of 4 bases in a genetic sequence represents an amino acid, which determines how that acid will be chained/folded into a protein. 
  Each amino acid has unique properties and can interact with neighboring amino acids.
  This means: while most genetic sequences will result in an inert chunks of proteins that will quickly break down, some sequences can result in robust organisms which are virtually immortal.
  The environment features temperature gradients, hydrothermal vents which provide minerals, sunlight for energy, and blocks to create geography.
  Temperature affects metabolism and efficiency, mineral are used to create spores for reproduction, and energy is essential for nearly amino acid interactions.

<p>
  It has a custom-made UI that allows for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Live-interaction with entities on screen.</li>
  <li>Simulation speed adjustment</li>
  <li>Creating new organisms via custom gene sequence</li>
  <li>Scheduled insertion of organisms</li>
  <li>Saving and loading multiple save files</li>
  <li>A very in-depth config of essentially all parameters</li>
  <li>And more...</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I should have made this in C or C#.
