A major personal project. Microbiome is an ever-evolving ecosystem simulation where, unlike many other such simulators, each organism is not limited to its predefined species. A single organism is comparable to a fictional protein, essentially a chain of amino acids which are defined by its genetic information. A set of 4 of bases in the genetic sequence represent an amino acid, along with how that acid will be chained/folded into the resulting protein. Each amino acid has unique properties and interactions with other amino acids. In other words, while most genetic sequences will result in an inert chunks of proteins that will soon break down, some sequences can result in robust organisms which are virtually immortal. The environment has temperature gradients, hydrothermal vents which provide minerals, and sunlight for energy. Temperature affects metabolism and efficiency, mineral are used to create spores for reproduction, and energy is essential for nearly amino acid interactions. Outside of performance limitations, the simulation proves to be highly interesting. Live-interaction UI was planned but never got added. Develped using Java.
